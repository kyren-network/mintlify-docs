Kyren Pay uses conventional HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

## HTTP Status Codes

| Status Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `200` | OK — Request succeeded |
| `201` | Created — Resource created successfully |
| `400` | Bad Request — Invalid parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized — Missing or invalid API key |
| `403` | Forbidden — Insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Not Found — Resource does not exist |
| `429` | Too Many Requests — Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Internal Server Error — Something went wrong on our end |

## Error Response Format

When an error occurs, the response body contains a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Bad Request",
  "error": {
    "field": "productId",
    "reason": "Product ID is required"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `code` | integer | HTTP status code |
| `message` | string | A human-readable error message |
| `error.field` | string | The parameter that caused the error (if applicable) |
| `error.reason` | string | Detailed explanation of what went wrong |

<Note>
  The `error` object is only present for validation errors (400). Other error types only include `code` and `message`.
</Note>

## Common Errors

### 400 Bad Request

Returned when the request body or parameters are invalid.

```json
{
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Bad Request",
  "error": {
    "field": "price",
    "reason": "Price must be at least 0.01"
  }
}
```

### 401 Unauthorized

Returned when the API key is missing or invalid.

```json
{
  "code": 401,
  "message": "Unauthorized"
}
```

### 404 Not Found

Returned when the requested resource does not exist.

```json
{
  "code": 404,
  "message": "Not Found"
}
```

### 429 Too Many Requests

Returned when you exceed the API rate limit (100 requests per minute).

```json
{
  "code": 429,
  "message": "Too Many Requests"
}
```

<Tip>
  Implement exponential backoff in your integration to handle rate limiting gracefully.
</Tip>

## Success Response Format

Successful responses always include `code: 0` and `message: "success"`:

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "message": "success",
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  }
}
```

For paginated endpoints, the `data` field contains `items` and `pagination`:

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "message": "success",
  "data": {
    "items": [...],
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "size": 20,
      "total": 42,
      "totalPages": 3
    }
  }
}
```
