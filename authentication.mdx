title: Authentication
description: Authenticate your API requests with API keys
---

All API requests must be authenticated using an API key passed in the `x-api-key` header.

## API Keys

Kyren Pay uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can manage your API keys from the [Merchant Dashboard](https://dashboard.kyren.top).

There are two types of API keys:

| Key Type | Prefix | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Live** | `kyren_live_` | Production environment — real payments |
| **Test** | `kyren_test_` | Sandbox environment — no real charges |

## Making Authenticated Requests

Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header of every request:

```bash
curl https://api.kyren.top/v1/products \
  -H "x-api-key: kyren_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

<Warning>
  **Keep your API keys secure.**
  - Never expose API keys in client-side code (JavaScript, mobile apps)
  - Never commit API keys to version control
  - Use environment variables to store keys in your server
  - Regenerate keys immediately if they are compromised
</Warning>

## Environments

| Environment | Base URL | API Key Prefix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Production | `https://api.kyren.top` | `kyren_live_` |
| Sandbox | `https://test-api.kyren.top` | `kyren_test_` |

<Info>
  Test and live API keys are completely separate. Data created with test keys is not visible in the live environment, and vice versa.
</Info>

## Regenerating API Keys

If your API key is compromised, you can regenerate it from the Dashboard:

1. Go to **Dashboard > Developer**
2. Click **Regenerate** next to the key you want to replace
3. Confirm the action

<Warning>
  Regenerating a key immediately invalidates the old key. Make sure to update all your integrations with the new key.
</Warning>

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, the API returns a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "code": 401,
  "message": "Unauthorized"
}
```

Common causes:
- Missing `x-api-key` header
- Invalid or expired API key
- Using a test key against the production URL (or vice versa)
