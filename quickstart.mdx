Follow these steps to integrate Kyren Pay and collect your first payment.

## Prerequisites

- A Kyren Pay merchant account ([sign up here](https://dashboard.kyren.top))
- Your API key (found in the Developer section of your dashboard)

## Step 1: Get your API Key

After signing up, navigate to **Dashboard > Developer** and copy your API key.

- **Test key**: `kyren_test_xxxxxxxxxxxx` — use this for development
- **Live key**: `kyren_live_xxxxxxxxxxxx` — use this for production

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure. Never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Create a Product

Create a product that represents what you're selling:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.kyren.top/v1/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: kyren_test_xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -d '{
    "name": "1000 AI Credits",
    "description": "Top up 1000 credits for AI API usage",
    "price": 9.99,
    "currency": "USD"
  }'
```

Save the `id` from the response — you'll need it to create checkout sessions.

## Step 3: Create a Checkout Session

When a customer wants to pay, create a checkout session:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.kyren.top/v1/checkouts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: kyren_test_xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -d '{
    "productId": "prod_abc123",
    "successUrl": "https://yoursite.com/success",
    "cancelUrl": "https://yoursite.com/cancel"
  }'
```

The response includes a `url` field — redirect your customer to this URL to complete payment.

## Step 4: Redirect to Checkout

Redirect the customer to the checkout URL returned in Step 3. They will see a hosted payment page where they can choose their preferred payment method.

```javascript
// Example: redirect in your web app
window.location.href = checkoutResponse.data.url;
```

## Step 5: Handle the Webhook

After payment is completed, Kyren Pay sends a webhook to your server:

```javascript
// Express.js example
app.post('/webhooks/kyren', express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }), (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-kyren-signature'];
  const timestamp = req.headers['x-kyren-timestamp'];
  const payload = req.body.toString();

  // Verify the signature (see Webhook Signatures for details)
  if (!verifySignature(payload, signature, timestamp)) {
    return res.status(400).send('Invalid signature');
  }

  const event = JSON.parse(payload);

  if (event.type === 'order.paid') {
    const orderId = event.data.order_id;
    const amount = event.data.amount;
    // Fulfill the order in your system
    console.log(`Payment received: ${amount} ${event.data.currency}`);
  }

  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

<Info>
  Configure your webhook URL in **Dashboard > Developer > Webhook Settings**.
