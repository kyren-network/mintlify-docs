## Handling Events

Here's how to handle different event types in your webhook endpoint:

```javascript
app.post('/webhooks/kyren', (req, res) => {
  // ... verify signature first ...

  const event = JSON.parse(req.body.toString());

  switch (event.type) {
    case 'order.paid':
      handleOrderPaid(event.data);
      break;
    case 'order.refunded':
      handleOrderRefunded(event.data);
      break;
    case 'checkout.expired':
      handleCheckoutExpired(event.data);
      break;
    default:
      console.log(`Unhandled event: ${event.type}`);
  }

  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```
